ZetaColorEditor
===============

Copy of ZetaColorEditor from CodeProject

My understanding of the CodeProject license is that this should be ok. No idea what/if I should apply a license this derivation though!

It is going to stay in .NET 2.0 for legacy support. If you want to upgrade it have a go!

I wanted to fix a few things and add support for Clarion. Make of it what you will!
